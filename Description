Module 8 Assignment Mapping
PROMPT
Identify which assignment option you implemented and describe what the peer grader will be able to do with the enhancement relative to the rubric requirements. Feel free to boast but focus on what the peer grader needs to know first.
I implemented the Types of things option. 

Open the URL and go to Go To -> Image-Things
Click the Image-Things and you will see the screen with the Things on the left panel and the map on the right one. 
If you click on a marker on the Map, you should see the highlighted corresponding Thing on the left panel (of course if it is an orphan image; an image without a thing you won't see any highlighted thing on the left :) )
If you click on the Thing on the left, you will see the corresponding marker on the map on the right panel. 
Just try it and i am looking forward for your feedback! Enjoy!
